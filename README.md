This repository contains my solutions to the **CP-31 problem sheet** - a curated list of competitive programming problems designed to systematically improve problem-solving skills for Codeforces.

## About CP-31 Sheet

The CP-31 sheet is a well-structured collection of Codeforces problems organized by difficulty ratings (800, 900, 1000, etc.). It helps programmers build a strong foundation in competitive programming through progressive difficulty levels.
